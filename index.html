    <h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The sole reason for the existence of this blog is to relieve my self of inner stress which has been building up for a long time.</p>
<p>Who knows if it will help at all, or what this might lead to.</p>
<p>One of my hopes is that someone, in a deep dark place, at some point, somehow discovers this website and can get motivation out of it, and maybe, feel less alone.</p>
<p>Because I believe, as cruel as it might sound. Seeing others suffer, especially in a similar way to one self, it can make you feel better, and have another perspective. It's almost like therapy.</p>

    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>I'm a 23 year old student, that somehow feels like I stopped mentally aging after 17, and I'm stuck.</p>
    <p>A lot has happened in my life in the past couple of years, much bad, but also much good.</p>
    <p>I've had the pleasure of knowing what being near death feels like, and what being in love feels like, like really deeply in love, soulmate kind of thing.</p>
    <p>And that crazy part is that I was able to experience these two totally different perspectives of ones lifetime within the same year, heck, the same month...</p>
    <p>As I've been thinking about these supposed parallels in life I've rather come to discover that they're not so different from eachother. Both bring a tremendous love for life and suffering, sometimes at the same time... </p>
    <P>It's currently the 12th of December 2022 as I'm writing this. Precisely at 03:42 AM (GMT+1). It's all text, on a simple html file, with no make up. I might decide to add that later.</P>
    <P>Might be alright for me to add that while I am writing this I keep being on the brink of exploding out in tears. Maybe that's because me and my girlfriend, someone who I consider to be my soulmate are having a really tough time right now. To the point where I stupidly decided not to see her for an entire 3 days.</P>
    <p>Now I know that might sound pathetic to anyone reading this (if that were to even ever happen.) Oh mind you by the way, I have an exam due in around 7 hours, which I barely studied for because I simply couldn't bring my mind to it.</p>
    <p>Almost forgetting that this section is just supposed to be about me, hi im a 23 year old kid who is struggling in life, is deeply in love, and doesn't quite know how to balance anything anymore. Life is hard, and I will beat it.</p>
